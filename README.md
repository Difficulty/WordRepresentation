Code and data for BioNLP word representation features.
Summary:This code and data are based upon Li et al "Improving Kernel-Based Protein-Protein Interaction Extraction by Unsupervised Word Representation". 
In the paper, we introduce the word representation approach:Brown clusters, vector clustering representation and distributed representation to boost the existing PPIe methods.
